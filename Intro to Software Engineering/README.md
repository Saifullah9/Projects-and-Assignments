# ECSE321 Project Group _number_ 02

As a development unit we are responsible to create a Coop management system that integrates Mycourses and myFuture. The development unit is split into 4 groups in order to focus on the different view points of the project. Group 02 is responsible for creating the viewpoint of the Student. The student view point should allow the student to register in an internship, submit course evaluations, view the progress of the internship, view the progress of the Coop program, and submit internship evaluation. A meeting with the client that requested the Applicaation was held and more information about the project specifics were detailed in the meeting miniutes. A domain model for the project was created and generated using UML lab to help us visualize the different classes and different methods that will be required in the backend. More over the database for the system is saved using the Heroku App. The model is serialized into SQL using Hibernate which is then saved on the Heroku server. further information about decisions taken as a group and meeting miniutes can be found in the following summary of the project.
